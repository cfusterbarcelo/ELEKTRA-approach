# ELEKTRA-approach
This github is an approach to ELEKTRokardiomatrix Application to biometric identification with Convolutional Neural Networks (ELEKTRA) where we show how the Elektrokardiomatrix (EKM) are built for one database and one user. 

The process of creating an EKM can be found on the image below together with the last phase of our project, user identification.

In this project, we perform steps 1, 2 and 3 from the pipeline. We start by processing the raw files of Elektrokardiograms (EKG) to lastly obtain the EKM as it can be seen in the Jupyter Notebook. All steps are detailed on it.
